A small Java project that implements a simple REST API to:

- list Entity entries
- send an Entity (to root, or attached to another entity)
- read an Entity

Uses Maven + Spring build and run
Uses Vert.X to implement the server+logic
Uses H2, an in-memory database, as no persistence is required.

To try the API, execute this command in a terminal:

----
mvn clean spring-boot:run
----

By default, there are 2 entities added. One root entity, which has a child subentity

You should now be able to see them:

----
curl http://localhost:8080/entities

----


Then add a new entity to the database, which has the parent entity with id=2:
----
curl -X POST -d "{ \"parentId\" : \"2\", \"data\" : { \"key\" : \"value\"} }"  http://localhost:8080/entity 

----


Then add a new entity to the database, which will be the root entity. Do not add any parent ID in the request body. Or add an unexisting one
----
curl -X POST -d "{ \"data\" : { \"key\" : \"value\"} }"  http://localhost:8080/entity 
----
or
----
curl -X POST -d "{ \"parentId\" : \"unexisting\", \"data\" : { \"key\" : \"value\"} }"  http://localhost:8080/entity 
----

Then retrieve an existing entity from the database
----
curl http://localhost:8080/entity?id=1
----
